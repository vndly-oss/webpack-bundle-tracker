# You may optionally reference a separate security_contact.yaml file
# to use information from that file for this repo. If you choose
# to reference another file here, the remainder of this file may either
# be left blank, or you may include specific sections where you wish to
# override the contents of the referenced file. When overriding a referenced
# file, the entire top-level object (e.g. 'owners') is overridden and
# must be specified here instead.
#
# Supported reference path formats include:
#    - "/another_project_in_this_repo/.security_config/security_contact.yaml"
#    - "/another_project_in_this_repo/"
#      (will append '.security_config/security_contact.yaml' to this location)
#    - "../another_project_in_this_repo/.security_config/security_contact.yaml"
#    - "git::https://ghe.megaleo.com/org/repo/"
#      (will use the '.security_config/security_contact.yaml' in this repo)
#    - "https://ghe.megaleo.com/raw/org/repo/branch/.security_config/security_contact.yaml"
